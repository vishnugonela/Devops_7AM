1. Write a dockerfile to create nginx image with "hello docker from <Vishnu>"
2. Write a dockerfile to create image to print container details in web-page. 
	Like container name: ----
	     container IP:   172.17.0.3
	     date:
3. Write a shell script to create a  10 containers
	- Check before creating contianer whether container is existed or not. if exist you have delete and create container
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    docker run --name docker-nginx$i -P -d nginx
done


4. Write a docker file to create image build with your container login via ssh with root login. 

5. Write a dockerfile to create image database engine (mysql).

6. Write a jenkins pipeline script to build below stages.
	Stage1. Build docker image with "2nd task" from above
	Stage2. Tag image with docker hub repo
	Stage3. Push image to docker hub with your login details
	Stage4. Pull image in your 'slave' machine (make sure docker installed)
	Stage5. Create a container in 'slave' machine and validate application is running. 

7. Task ---> https://github.com/infracloudio/csvserver




The task you need to do is to deploy a "hello-world" docker container in HA using Nginx.

Below is the image that you need to use for docker.
 
https://hub.docker.com/r/tutum/hello-world/ 

This image takes care of displaying the IP of node.

Node Information:
Node 1: 13.59.179.85
Node 2: 18.216.134.104
Node 3: 18.216.165.18

Use Node3 to deploy Nginx. 

So the goal is, everytime a request comes to Nginx, it should show different IPs(i.e IPs of Node1 and Node2).

You have 1 hour to complete the task.

PS: Username is ubuntu and you have to install docker in the nodes.
